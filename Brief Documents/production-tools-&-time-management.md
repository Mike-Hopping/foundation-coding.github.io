• Chrome Developer Tools
• Live Server Extension for VSCode
• Javascript Linting
• Dual Monitors
• Stack Overflow Website

// TIME MANAGEMENT TOOLS //

The two online time management tools I used were Trello and a burn down chart of deliverables for the assignment on Google Sheets.

I found them very helpful and they made breaking down and organizing the tasks into order of priority and hours of time to be spent, very straightforward.

I kept very closely to the times set in the burn down chart and only went over or under the amount of time I had set for tasks by by an hour or two in some cases.

I spent a lot of time working on the assignment at home, so in some cases it was hard to keep track of all the time outside of class time I spent working on certain tasks, but I partly took this extra time into account when I was planning the amount of time for certain tasks.

Improvements that I could make would mainly be better accounting the time spent outside class hours working on the assignment and factoring that into the burn down chart more accurately.
