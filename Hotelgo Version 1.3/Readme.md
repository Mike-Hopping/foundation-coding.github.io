Hotelgo is an accomodation website that allows users to search for accomodation options by name or choose from a list of options which can be filtered by category.

On the landing page, the user can click one of the four category buttons, hotels 1-2 people max, motels 2-4 people max, hostels 1-6 people max, and houses 1-4 people max.

The buttons display the category and maximum and minimum number of people that can be booked to stay at that option and clicking that button filters the entire list of options to only display the accomodation options that match those conditions.

There is also a datepicker on the landing page which users can select the start and end dates for the amount of days that they intend to stay at the option they have chosen which would be another option to filter the list of accomodation to display the results based on the number of days that they are staying.

From the filtered list of results the user can then click the option they have chosen, which will take them to a details screen which displays the relevant information of that accomodation and from there review the details and price and click a link to an external site where they would then proceed to book the accomodation.
